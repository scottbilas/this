    This lecture was the inspiration for many game engines. Notably, the Unity game engine has a data-driven and scriptable component-based game object architecture and serialization system that was directly derived from this talk, including many of its core API's.

    Over the years, GameObjects+Components has gone from fun original idea, to common practice, to tired and often scorned. ECS, which has been gaining traction recently, was supposedly originally inspired in part by my work, at least according to the [wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system).

- title: "FuBi: Automatic Function Exporting for Scripting and Networking"
  id: fubi
  conference: Game Developers Conference, San Jose, 2001
  details: |
    This was derived from my Gem from Game Programming Gems I. I invented a neat and cheap way to expose C++ functions to a scripting language. The usual methods require macros or postprocessors or IDL's or manual registration or other horrors. My method was to simply tag the function to be dllexported, then at runtime walk the exports and un-mangle the C++ names to extract the argument types. Neat and cheap, the best combo.
